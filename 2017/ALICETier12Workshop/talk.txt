Feedback Loop failure.
Show pic of status, tried to start 50 jobs, and suddenly it climbs to 150 starting job and then blows up with failed jobs.
Then one is left with a chase down the slope to get jobs under control again.
Attempts were made with 5 job increases but same thing happens.
The entire problem is mitigated by getting more bandwidth....

uptime is 94.55% mostly due to network fails for standard tests.
include graph from alimon


ska wont use bandwidth till dec or later due to various factors but one being dumping the scientists with tapes.


cvmfs stratum1 onsite for sagrid and others.  [NETWORK]

most error_e are due to ttl for second round jobs and dying due to hopelessly slow network
